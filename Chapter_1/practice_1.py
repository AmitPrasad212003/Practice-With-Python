# Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star     
#                 BY JANE TAYLOR
      
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
# How I wonder what you are!
# Up above the world so high,
# Like a diamond in the sky.

# When the blazing sun is gone,
# When he nothing shines upon,
# Then you show your little light,
# Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

# Then the traveler in the dark
# Thanks you for your tiny spark,
# How could he see where to go,
# If you did not twinkle so?

# In the dark blue sky you keep,
# Often through my curtains peep
# For you never shut your eye,
# Till the sun is in the sky.

# As your bright and tiny spark
# Lights the traveler in the dark,
# Though I know not what you are,
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

#2. Use REPL and print the table of 5 using it. 
# >>> for i in range(1,11): 
# ...     print("5 *",i," = " ,i*5)
# ...
# 5 * 1  =  5
# 5 * 2  =  10
# 5 * 3  =  15
# 5 * 4  =  20
# 5 * 5  =  25
# 5 * 6  =  30
# 5 * 7  =  35
# 5 * 8  =  40
# 5 * 9  =  45
# 5 * 10  =  50

# 3. Install an external module and use it to perform an operation of your interest. 

# import pyttsx3
# engine = pyttsx3.init()
# engine.say("Deva come here")
# engine.runAndWait()

# 4. Write a python program to print the contents of a directory using the os module.Search online for the function which does that.

#import os

#path = '/Users'  # Specify your directory path
#for entry in os.listdir(path): # Use the os module to List all files and directory in the specified
   # print(entry) # Print each files and directory name
