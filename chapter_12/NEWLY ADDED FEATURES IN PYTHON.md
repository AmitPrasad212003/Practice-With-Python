## Python 3.10

### Pattern Matching

Python 3.10 introduced structural pattern matching, a powerful feature that allows for more expressive and readable code.

```python
def http_error(status):
    match status:
        case 400:
            return "Bad request"
        case 404:
            return "Not found"
        case 418:
            return "I'm a teapot"
        case _:
            return "Something's wrong with the internet"
```

### Parenthesized Context Managers

Python 3.10 allows the use of multiple context managers in a single `with` statement using parentheses.

```python
with (
    open('file1.txt') as file1,
    open('file2.txt') as file2
):
    # Process files
```

### Precise Error Messages

Error messages in Python 3.10 are more precise, making it easier to understand what went wrong.

```python
# Before Python 3.10
print(unknown_var)  # NameError: name 'unknown_var' is not defined

# Python 3.10
print(unknown_var)  # NameError: name 'unknown_var' is not defined. Did you mean: 'known_var'?
```

## Python 3.11

### Exception Groups and except*

Python 3.11 introduces exception groups and the `except*` syntax, allowing multiple exceptions to be caught and handled simultaneously.

```python
try:
    raise ExceptionGroup("group", [ValueError("value error"), TypeError("type error")])
except* ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught ValueError: {e}")
except* TypeError as e:
    print(f"Caught TypeError: {e}")
```

### Faster Python

Python 3.11 includes performance improvements that make it significantly faster. Optimizations include changes to the CPython interpreter, making common operations quicker.

### Typing Improvements

Python 3.11 enhances typing hints, including support for `Self` and variadic generics.

```python
from typing import Self

class MyClass:
    def method(self) -> Self:
        return self
```

## Python 3.12

### Subinterpreters

Python 3.12 introduces subinterpreters, allowing multiple independent interpreters to run in the same process. This feature aims to improve concurrency and parallelism.

### New Syntax Features

Python 3.12 adds several new syntax features, such as support for more concise and readable code constructs.

```python
# Example of new syntax feature in Python 3.12
# Details to be added as per final release notes
```

### Improved Performance

Performance improvements continue in Python 3.12, with enhancements to memory management, garbage collection, and more efficient code execution.

## Conclusion

Each new version of Python brings enhancements that improve the language's usability, performance, and capabilities. Staying updated with these features allows developers to write better, more efficient code.
